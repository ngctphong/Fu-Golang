Time to practice what you learned!

1) Create a new Go code file, set a package and add the main function
2) Create two new variables:
  - For your first name
  - and your last name

  Create those variables in two different ways (with and without 
  explicit type assignment).

3) Output the two variables in the command line and execute the code file
  to see the output in the command line.

4) Also add two other variables:
  - The current year
  - Your birth year

  Again, create those variables in two different ways and set the correct
  value type (choose an appropriate type).

5) Calculate the difference ("age") between the two years and
  store it in a new variable. Output that result in the command line.

6) Overwrite the value stored in the "current year" variable with
  the previous value + 1 (i.e. next year). Calculate the next year,
  don't just change the number.
  Repeat step 5) with that new value (without changing any of the previous code).

Try all those steps on your own first, then have a look at my solution
